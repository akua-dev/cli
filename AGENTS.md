# Repository guidance

## Release contract

- `scripts/release.ts` is the source of truth for target IDs, Bun targets,
  archive names, executable names, SHA-256 files, and release manifests.
- Every target must produce an archive containing the `akua` executable and its
  adjacent target-native package runtime, an adjacent `.sha256`, an entry in
  `checksums.txt`, and a native install smoke covering both cloud commands and a
  real `akua pkg init` → `check` → `render` → `inspect` flow.
- Keep the tested matrix aligned across the script and workflows: macOS
  arm64/x64, glibc Linux arm64/x64, and Windows x64. Use baseline Bun targets
  for Linux x64 and Windows x64.
- Release assets are immutable. Never add clobber/force upload behavior; the tap
  handoff runs only after published assets are downloaded and re-verified.

## Ownership boundaries

- This CLI repository owns the canonical `akua` executable and release artifacts.
- `skills/effect-v4/SKILL.md` is the only repository-local skill; it governs
  production CLI and script changes.
- `akua-dev/homebrew-tap` owns the `akua` formula, formula tests, and the reviewed
  formula-update PR. CLI automation sends only the verified release manifest
  contract.

## Validation

Run `mise run check` and `mise run generate:check` for every change. Release
changes also require the focused release/workflow tests and a current-host
compiled archive smoke through `mise run release:smoke`.

## Public API command contract

- `openapi/public.json` is the only source of truth for public routes,
  request/response schemas, operation IDs, authentication, and error shapes.
  Do not duplicate endpoint definitions, request types, or status-error maps in
  handwritten CLI code.
- Generate the typed Effect API surface from that contract. Keep handwritten
  code limited to generic command parsing, request assembly, authentication
  composition, rendering, and terminal wiring.
- Public commands remain provider-neutral. Do not add commands, flags, file
  readers, environment variables, or credential loaders for a particular cloud
  provider, cluster vendor, or product integration. Users pass provider-specific
  data only through the public API's generated request body, for example via
  `akua secrets create --input -`.
- The generic executor accepts only generated path, query, header, and body
  inputs. It must reject unknown fields before sending a request, redact
  sensitive input in diagnostics, and preserve the generated structured error
  union for callers and JSON output.
- Generation must be deterministic and fail on warnings, skipped public
  operations, or unrepresented request/response/error contracts. Add support to
  the OpenAPI producer or generator; never hide a contract gap with a manual
  endpoint implementation.

## Effect v4 production code

Before changing production CLI code in `src/` or `scripts/`, load
`skills/effect-v4/SKILL.md`. Keep command flow on the audited Effect v4
services/layers and tagged-failure model; only the binary terminal owns the
runtime/fiber handoff. Before handoff, run the skill's source scan, focused Bun
tests, and `mise run check`; inspect each source scan hit rather than treating
the command as a cosmetic check.

- All production control flow and recoverable failure paths use
  `Effect.Effect` with a typed error channel. Do not use raw `throw`, native
  Promise control flow, `async`, `await`, or untyped failure helpers in `src/`
  or `scripts/`.
- Pure immutable data, types, and constants may remain plain TypeScript. Do not
  add Effect imports to a module that cannot perform work or fail.
- Keep direct host I/O inside named live service adapters. Only minimal
  executable `import.meta.main` guards may own runtime/fiber handoff.
- Preserve the structural invariant tests whenever this boundary changes. A
  source scan is a review aid, not a substitute for the invariant test.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file concise and durable. Add only repository-wide rules that are not
obvious from the code, and prefer pointers to authoritative files and commands
over duplicated implementation detail.
