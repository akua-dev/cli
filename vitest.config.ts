 * Vitest replaces `bun test` as this package's test runner. Effect is this
 * CLI's control-flow model end to end (see AGENTS.md), so tests need
 * `@effect/vitest`'s `it.effect`/`TestClock` primitives, which only run
 * under vitest, not `bun:test`. Tests still execute inside the Bun process
 * (`bun run test` -> `vitest run`), so `Bun.spawn` and other Bun globals used
 * by process-boundary tests remain available.
